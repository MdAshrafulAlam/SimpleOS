hi guys,

We simply know about Operating System. Litterally, an operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless. 

In this case, process is very important factorm for OS. In general-purpose systems, some way is needed to create processes as needed during operation. There are four principal events led to processes creation.
System initialiazation.
Execution of a process Creation system calls by a running process.
A user request to create a new process.
Initialization of a batch job.
